                         <p>Published in 1877, Leo Tolstoy referred to "Anna Karenina" as the first novel he’d written, despite having published several novellas and novels before — including a little book called "War and Peace". His sixth novel was produced after a prolonged period of creative frustration for Tolstoy as he worked fruitlessly on a novel based on the life of Russian Tsar Peter the Great, a project that went nowhere slowly and drove Tolstoy to despair. He found inspiration in the local story of a woman who had thrown herself in front of a train after discovering that her lover had been unfaithful to her; this event became the kernel that eventually sprouted into what many believe to be the greatest Russian novel of all time — and one of the greatest novels, period.
						 <p>For the modern reader, "Anna Karenina" (and any 19th-century Russian novel) can seem imposing and daunting. Its length, its cast of characters, the Russian names, the distance between our own experience and more than a century of societal evolution combined with the distance between a long-gone culture and modern sensibilities make it easy to assume that "Anna Karenina" will be difficult to understand. And yet the book remains immensely popular, and not solely as an academic curiosity: Every day regular readers pick up this classic and fall in love with it.
						 <p>The explanation for its perpetual popularity is twofold. The simplest and most obvious reason is Tolstoy’s immense talent: His novels haven’t become classics solely because of their complexity and the literary tradition he worked in — they’re fantastically well written, entertaining, and compelling, and "Anna Karenina" is no exception. In other words, "Anna Karenina" is an enjoyable reading experience.
						 <p>The second reason for its staying power is an almost-contradictory combination of the evergreen nature of its themes and its transitional nature. "Anna Karenina" simultaneously tells a story based on social attitudes and behaviors that are just as powerful and entrenched today as they were in the 1870s and broke incredible new ground in terms of literary technique. The literary style — explosively fresh when published — means the novel feels modern today despite its age.</p>
	
						 
						 <h2>Overview</h2>
						 <p>"Anna Karenina" follows two main plot tracks, both fairly superficial love stories; while there are many philosophical and social issues tackled by various sub-plots in the story (most notably a section near the end where characters set off for Serbia to support an attempt at independence from Turkey) these two relationships are the core of the book. In one, Anna Karenina embarks on an affair with a passionate young cavalry officer. In the second, Anna’s sister-in-law Kitty initially rejects, then later embraces the advances of an awkward young man named Levin.
						 <p>The story opens in the home of Stepan "Stiva" Oblonsky, whose wife Dolly has discovered his infidelity. Stiva has been carrying on an affair with a former governess to their children and has been pretty open about it, scandalizing society and humiliating Dolly, who threatens to leave him. Stiva is paralyzed by this turn of events; his sister, Princess Anna Karenina, arrives to try and calm the situation down. Anna is beautiful, intelligent, and married to the prominent government minister Count Alexei Karenin, and she is able to mediate between Dolly and Stiva and get Dolly to agree to stay in the marriage.
						 <p>Dolly has a younger sister, Princess Ekaterina "Kitty" Shcherbatskaya, who is being courted by two men: Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin, a socially-awkward landowner, and Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, a handsome, passionate military officer. As you might expect, Kitty is enamored of the dashing officer and chooses Vronsky over Levin, which devastates the earnest man. However, things take an immediate gossipy turn when Vronsky encounters Anna Karenina and falls deeply for her on first sight, which in turn devastates Kitty. Kitty is so hurt by this turn of events she actually becomes sick. For her part, Anna finds Vronsky attractive and compelling, but she dismisses her feelings as a temporary infatuation and returns home to Moscow.
						 <p>Vronsky, however, pursues Anna there and tells her that he loves her. When her husband becomes suspicious, Anna fiercely denies any involvement with Vronsky, but when he’s involved in a terrible accident during a horse race, Anna can’t hide her feelings for Vronsky and confesses that she loves him. Her husband, Karenin, is mainly concerned with his public image. He refuses her a divorce, and she moves to their country estate and begins a torrid affair with Vronsky that soon finds her pregnant with his child. Anna is tortured by her decisions, wracked with guilt over betraying her marriage and abandoning her son with Karenin and gripped by powerful jealousy in relation to Vronsky.</p>
						 <p>Anna has a difficult childbirth while her husband visits her in the country; upon seeing Vronsky there he has a moment of grace and agrees to divorce her if she wishes, but leaves the final decision with her after forgiving her for her infidelity. Anna is outraged by this, resenting his ability to suddenly take the high road, and she and Vronsky travel with the baby, going to Italy. Anna is restless and lonely, however, so they eventually return to Russia, where Anna finds herself increasingly isolated. The scandal of her affair leaves her unwanted in the social circles she once traveled in, while Vronsky enjoys a double standard and is free to do as he likes. Anna begins to suspect and fear that Vronsky has fallen out of love with her and has become unfaithful, and she grows increasingly angry and unhappy. As her mental and emotional state deteriorates, she goes to the local train station and impulsively throws herself in front of an oncoming train, killing herself. Her husband, Karenin, takes in her and Vronsky’s child.</p>						 
						 <p>Meanwhile, Kitty and Levin meet again. Levin has been at his estate, trying unsuccessfully to convince his tenants to modernize their farming techniques, while Kitty has been recovering at a spa. The passage of time and their own bitter experiences have changed them, and they quickly fall in love and marry. Levin chafes under the restrictions of married life and feels little affection for his son when he’s born. He has a crisis of faith that leads him back to the church, becoming suddenly fervent in his belief. A near-tragedy that threatens his child’s life also sparks in him the first sense of true love for the boy.</p>
						 
						 
						 <h2>The Structure</h2>
						 <p>"Anna Karenina" wasn’t the first Realist novel, but it is regarded as a nearly-perfect example of the literary movement. A Realist novel attempts to depict everyday things without artifice, as opposed to the more flowery and idealist traditions that most novels pursue. Realist novels tell grounded stories and avoid any sort of embellishment. The events in "Anna Karenina" are set out simply; people behave in realistic, believable ways, and events are always explicable and their causes and consequences can be traced from one to the next.
						 <p>As a result, "Anna Karenina" remains relatable to modern audiences because there are no artistic flourishes that mark it in a certain moment of the literary tradition, and the novel is also a time capsule of what life was like for a certain class of people in 19th-century Russia because Tolstoy took pains to make his descriptions accurate and factual instead of pretty and poetic. It also means that while characters in "Anna Karenina" represent segments of society or prevailing attitudes, they aren’t symbols — they are offered as people, with layered and sometimes contradictory beliefs.
						 <p>Stream of Consciousness is most often associated with the groundbreaking postmodern works of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf and other 20th century writers, but Tolstoy pioneered the technique in "Anna Karenina". For Tolstoy, it was used in service of his Realist goals — his peek into the thoughts of his characters reinforces the realism by showing that the physical aspects of his fictional world are consistent — different characters see the same things the same way — while perceptions about people shift and change from character to character because each person has only a sliver of the truth. For example, characters think differently of Anna when they learn of her affair, but the portrait artist Mikhailov, unaware of the affair, never changes his superficial opinion of the Karenins.
